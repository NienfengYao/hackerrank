    * The input method has different behavior on my pc and hackerrank server. So I do multiple check.
    * Map is key in this exercise and there is no built-in map in C. I'll get "Terminated due to timeout" with linear search in server with full test.
* Day 9: Recursion
  * C:
    * It pass with full test on hackerrank server, but get "Segmentation fault (core dumped)" in my local pc.
